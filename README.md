# bsc-hemi-bridge

> This repo is now archived. This was an alpha app built in one afternoon that allowed users to bridge HEMI tokens on the Hemi chain from/to Binance Smart Chain post Hemi TGE. There are now official providers, and it's recommended those are used.

## Dev Setup

Run:

```sh
npm i
```
